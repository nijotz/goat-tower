            To the south is a path to a canyon.  A great tower stands to the
            north of you.  You squint to try and make out who or what is on the
            tower.  You think you see... goats??  You realize there is a goat
            under a tree staring at you.  Hanging around her neck is a sign
            that says "Hello!"  Next to the goat is a post with a big red
            button on the top with a skull and crossbones printed on it.

            There's a sudden flash and a loud boom.  You recover from the
            disorientation to discover you're covered in a warm fluid.  Wiping
            the fluid from your eyes and looking down at yourself you see it's
            the blood of the goat.  But there's another goat standing in its
            place... in the pool of blood of its predecessor.

            To the south is a path to a canyon.  A great tower stands to the
            north of you.  You squint to try and make out who or what is on the
            tower.  You think you see... goats??  You realize there is a goat
            under a tree staring at you.  Hanging around her neck is a sign
            that says "Hello!"  Next to the goat is a post with a big red
            button on the top with a skull and crossbones printed on it.

            You come upon a vast chasm.  The tattered remains of a roap bridge hang over the edge.  A sign says "The Commonwealth of Aegagrus Department of Public Works has recieved funding to repair the roap bridge.  Construction is expected to be completed in March of 2015." The sign is posted to a large oak tree.  Engraved on the oak tree are the following:

            {% for engraving in actor.get_attribute('engravings')|fromjson %}
            {{engraving}}
            {% endfor %}

            At the base of the tree is a knife.

            There's a sudden flash and a loud boom.  You recover from the
            disorientation to discover you're covered in a warm fluid.  Wiping
            the fluid from your eyes and looking down at yourself you see it's
            the blood of the goat.  But there's another goat standing in its
            place... in the pool of blood of its predecessor.
